Hi Bright,

Welcome to Quick Bank. My name is Ben your supervisor remember we had a quick discusion earlier on?

Anyway this is a new ticket for you.

1. Create a new repository for our data science team for a new project.

	* repo name: loanapp

2. Add the following data scientist to the repository

	* Wonder ==> Github Username: Marvrog
	* Manuel ==> Github Username: ekasiedu13
	* Toni ==> Github Username: Anthony-Asamoah
	
7. Setup a github project and add the following four(4) work items to it.

	* Setup Infrastructure -- assign to Yourself
	* Build model and deploy manually -- assign to Wonder 
	* Automate Model building and deployment -- assign to Yourself
	* Document the entire solution -- assign to your self
	
3. Create four(4) new branches with the following names from main

	* setup
	* dev
	* stage
	* prod
	
4. Create four(4) new environment with the following names

	* setup
	* dev
	* stage
	* prod

5. Map each branch name with its environment. eg branch_name: dev ----Maps To----> environment: dev

6. Setup a CI to validate pull request before merge request can be approved. If validation fails, merge request should not be approved.

7. Collaborate with the data science team to come up with a robost pipeline to deploy the model into dev, stage and prod environment.

8. Setup monitoring tools, logging for dev, stage and main (deploy to production environment) models.

9. Document your entire solution with detailed architectural diagrams.

Note: Use Infrastructure as Code as Much as Possible. If possible use IAC only unless otherwise.
