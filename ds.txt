Data Sciece Use Case
---------------------

As a data scientist at Quick Bank, your goal is to develop an end-to-end machine learning application for automating the loan approval process. 
The application should predict whether a loan should be granted to an individual or not based on their information.

You will work with historical loan data, including applicant details, financial data, credit history, employment information, 
loan amounts, and loan repayment status. By analyzing this data, you will build a machine learning model that can accurately predict loan approvals.

Once the model is developed and trained, you will deploy it as an application or API that can be integrated into Quick Bank's 
loan approval system. The application will take input parameters, such as applicant information, and provide loan approval predictions in real-time.

Throughout the development process, you will ensure data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment. 
Additionally, you will collaborate with relevant stakeholders to gather feedback and refine the application based on their requirements.

By building this end-to-end machine learning application, Quick Bank will be able to streamline their loan approval process, 
make data-driven decisions, and improve efficiency in granting loans while minimizing the risk of defaults.
